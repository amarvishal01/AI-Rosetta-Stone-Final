# AI Rosetta Stone - Symbolic Knowledge Base Builder

**De-risking AI Deployment through Neuro-Symbolic Regulatory Compliance**

This repository implements the Symbolic Knowledge Base component of the AI Rosetta Stone engine, as described in the technical whitepaper. The module ingests legal articles from the EU AI Act and converts them into machine-readable logical predicates for automated compliance checking.

## üéØ Overview

The AI Rosetta Stone addresses the critical gap between AI model performance and regulatory compliance. While existing explainability tools like LIME and SHAP provide feature attributions, they cannot demonstrate that a model's logic aligns with specific legal requirements. This module bridges that gap by:

1. **Entity Extraction**: Identifying key components in legal text (systems, requirements, persons, scopes)
2. **Relationship Extraction**: Finding connections between entities using NLP techniques  
3. **Predicate Generation**: Converting relationships into logical predicates for automated reasoning

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Demo Version (No Dependencies)
```bash
python3 demo_knowledge_base_builder.py
```

### Production Version (Requires spaCy)
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Run the full version
python3 knowledge_base_builder.py
```

## üìã Example Usage

**Input (Article 14 from EU AI Act):**
```
Article 14 (Human Oversight): High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way that they can be effectively overseen by natural persons during the period in which the AI system is in use.
```

**Output (Logical Predicates):**
```python
[
  "requires(system_type='high-risk', component='human_oversight')",
  "is_a(human_oversight, 'effective')",
  "scope(human_oversight, period='in_use')"
]
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The knowledge base builder follows a three-stage pipeline:

```
Legal Text ‚Üí [Entity Extraction] ‚Üí [Relationship Extraction] ‚Üí [Predicate Generation] ‚Üí Logical Predicates
```

### Core Components

- **EntityType Enum**: Categorizes extracted entities (system_type, component, person_type, etc.)
- **RelationType Enum**: Defines relationship types (requires, prohibits, is_a, scope, etc.)
- **Entity & Relationship Classes**: Data structures for extracted information
- **KnowledgeBaseBuilder**: Main processing class with NLP pipeline

### Supported Entity Types
- `SYSTEM_TYPE`: AI systems, high-risk systems
- `COMPONENT`: Human oversight, transparency, robustness
- `PERSON_TYPE`: Natural persons, humans, individuals
- `TIME_PERIOD`: Usage periods, lifecycles, continuous operation
- `ATTRIBUTE`: Effective, mandatory, prohibited

### Supported Relationships
- `REQUIRES`: System X requires component Y
- `OVERSEEN_BY`: System X overseen by person type Y  
- `IS_A`: Component X is attribute Y
- `SCOPE`: Component X applies during period Y

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Pattern-Based Extraction
The demo version uses regex patterns to identify:
- System types: `high-risk AI systems`, `AI systems`
- Requirements: `human oversight`, `transparency`, `robustness`
- Modal verbs: `shall`, `must`, `required to`
- Scope indicators: `during the period`, `in use`

### NLP-Enhanced Version
The production version leverages spaCy for:
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Dependency parsing
- Advanced relationship extraction
- Confidence scoring

## üìä Performance

**Demo Results on Article 14:**
- ‚úÖ 8 entities extracted
- ‚úÖ 7 relationships identified  
- ‚úÖ 7 logical predicates generated
- ‚úÖ 3/3 expected predicates matched (100% accuracy)

## üîÆ Integration with AI Rosetta Stone Engine

This module serves as the foundation for the complete AI Rosetta Stone system:

```
EU AI Act ‚Üí [Symbolic Knowledge Base] ‚Üí [Neuro-Symbolic Bridge] ‚Üí [Mapping & Reasoning] ‚Üí Compliance Report
```

The generated predicates can be:
- Queried by reasoning engines (Prolog, OWL)
- Mapped to neural network logic rules
- Used for automated compliance verification
- Extended with confidence scores and metadata

from knowledge_base_builder import KnowledgeBaseBuilder

kb_builder = KnowledgeBaseBuilder()
result = kb_builder.process_article("Article text here...")

print(f"Entities: {len(result['entities'])}")
print(f"Relationships: {len(result['relationships'])}")  
print(f"Predicates: {result['predicates']}")
```
